In his book _Advice to a Young Tradesman_, Benjamin Franklin suggested that 'Time is Money'. Although this principle plays out well in the labour market, a typical employement contract details exactly how many hours you are expected to work per week for X amount of money.

But to say time _is_ money implies that our time has a price. Understanding that money and time are different things is one of the most significant shifts you can make in your financial and working life. If we choose to see time as infinitely valuable and irreplaceable, we can make better decisions about how we use it, and better decisions about our money and how we earn it.

Rather than putting a price on our time and justifying the sacrifice for money, we can invest our time doing what we value and changing out perspective on money. Earning money isn't a one-dimensional thing - you put in the hours and you get paid.

So here begins my journey towards less reliance on _active_ income (exchanging my time for money), and learning how to build _passive income_ (money generating assets).
